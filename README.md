# ItemTubesAddon

## Description

This addon simply turns glass into item transport tubes.
Any items fired inside of glass will travel through the glass, like a hopper that can go any direction.
Any glass works, and different glasses will not interfere with each other.


## Credits

- @Scommander for the original Datapack that can be found [here](https://github.com/Scommander/ItemTubesDatapack)
- @Miniontoby for rewriting the datapack's function files to work in bedrock


## Notes

- **This is the Minecraft Bedrock version of Scommander's ItemTubes Datapack! So ONLY support/assistance for Bedrock users can be found HERE! For Java support/assistance go to [Scommander's repo](https://github.com/Scommander/ItemTubesDatapack)**
- Bedrock edition does the item firing of droppers a bit different which made me have to teleport the item into the glass if there is glass below the item, so place a dropper 1 block above the glass to make the dropper work
