pack.name=Item Transport Tubes - Addon by Miniontoby (Original Java Datapack by Scommander)
pack.description=This addon simply turns glass into item transport tubes. Any items fired inside of glass will travel through the glass, like a hopper that can go any direction. Any glass works, and different glasses will not interfere with each other.
